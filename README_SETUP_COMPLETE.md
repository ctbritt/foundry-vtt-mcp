## 📝 To Configure Map Generation

### In Foundry VTT:
1. Open https://foundry.azthir-terra.com
2. Load your world (emerald-dreams)
3. Go to **Module Settings** → **Foundry MCP Bridge**
4. Click **"Configure Map Generation"** button

### Choose Your Mode:

**Local ComfyUI:**
- Select "Local ComfyUI" radio
- Check "Auto-start Service"
- Click "Check Status"
- If available → you're ready!
- If not → ComfyUI needs to be installed on server

**Remote RunPod (Recommended):**
- Select "Remote Service" radio
- Enter RunPod API Key: `rpa_...`
- Enter RunPod Endpoint ID: `pnto...`
- (Optional) Configure S3:
  - S3 Bucket name
  - S3 Region
  - Access Key ID
  - Secret Access Key
- Click "Apply Settings"

### Test It:
Ask Claude:
```
Generate a medium 1536x1536 tavern battlemap
```

## 🐛 Known Issue: get-character Timeout

The `get-character` tool times out on some characters (likely due to complex data). This is a data processing issue, not a connection problem.

**Workaround:**
Use `list-characters` instead to get basic character info, which works fine.

**To Debug:**
Open Foundry browser console (F12) and test the query handler directly (see TIMEOUT_FIX.md).
