- Performance optimizations eliminating Claude Desktop input lag

‚úÖ PRODUCTION TESTED & WORKING:
- "Do a public insight roll for Clark" correctly targets player Pete who owns character Clark Dragov
- Natural language processing handles complex roll requests with modifiers
- Real-time tracking shows completion status and player responses
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Zero performance impact on Claude Desktop responsiveness

üöÄ AUGUST 2, 2025 SESSION - ROLL TOOL CONSOLIDATION:
- Removed confusing broadcast-roll-message tool from MCP server entirely
- Consolidated into single request-player-rolls tool with clear public/private modes
- Enhanced tool description to clarify private parameter functionality
- Simplified system: One tool handles all roll scenarios with boolean flag
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors and rebuilt both packages successfully

üìä CURRENT TOOL COUNT: 16 total MCP tools (Phase 1: 7, Phase 2: 3, Phase 3: 6)

## üöÄ AUGUST 3, 2025 SESSION - VERSION 0.3.1 GM SECURITY RELEASE:

### üîí **CRITICAL SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**
**Status:** Production-ready GM-only access control implemented
**Impact:** MCP bridge now completely restricted to Game Master users

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features Implemented:**

1. **Module-Level GM Validation** - `packages/foundry-module/src/main.ts`
   - Silent GM check: `isGMUser(): boolean` 
   - Module startup restricted to GM users only
   - Non-GM users see no error messages, just access restriction log

2. **Query Handler Security** - `packages/foundry-module/src/queries.ts`
   - **All 14 query handlers** now protected with `validateGMAccess()`
   - Silent failure pattern: Returns `{ error: 'Access denied', success: false }`
   - Zero notifications or error messages for non-GM users

3. **GM Status Notifications** - Enhanced user experience
   - Connection banner: "üîó MCP Bridge connected successfully (GM only)"
   - Clear GM identification in console logs
   - Professional status messaging for authorized users

### üéØ **Security Architecture:**
```typescript
// Applied to all 14 query handlers:
const gmCheck = this.validateGMAccess();
if (!gmCheck.allowed) {
  return { error: 'Access denied', success: false };
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Version 0.3.1 Achievements:**
- **Complete Security Coverage:** All MCP functionality GM-restricted
- **Silent Failures:** Non-GM users experience no errors or notifications  
- **Performance Optimized:** Early validation checks with minimal overhead
- **User Experience:** Clear GM-only messaging for authorized access
- **Production Ready:** Comprehensive access control foundation established

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL STATUS - August 2, 2025 Session Issues

### üö® **Phase 4 Rollback Required**
**Issue:** Dice roll system implementation caused MCP connection failures
**Status:** Rolled back to Phase 3 stable version
**Impact:** Claude Desktop shows "foundry-mcp" as disabled

### üîß **Immediate Priority Issues:**

1. **üéØ GM-Only Security Implementation** (CRITICAL)
   - MCP Bridge should only be accessible to GM users
   - Silent failures for non-GM users (no error messages)
   - GM connection status banner when connected
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED

2. **üéØ MCP Connection Resolution** (CRITICAL)  
   - Claude Desktop shows foundry-mcp as disabled
   - Multiple restart attempts failed
   - Root cause: Unknown connection issue
   - Status: BROKEN - NEEDS INVESTIGATION

### üìö **Session Lessons Learned:**

**‚ùå What Went Wrong:**
1. **API Compatibility Issues**: `game.world.getFlag` not a function in Foundry v13.346
2. **Port Conflicts**: MCP server conflicting with Foundry VTT on port usage
3. **Overengineering**: Added complex dice roll system before fixing basic connection
4. **Configuration Confusion**: Mixed stdio vs socket.io transport modes
5. **Premature Feature Addition**: Should have implemented GM-only security FIRST

**‚úÖ What We Learned:**
1. **Security First**: GM-only restrictions should be the foundation, not an afterthought
2. **API Defensive Programming**: Always check API availability before using Foundry methods
3. **Connection Stability**: MCP connection must be rock-solid before adding features
4. **Port Management**: MCP server uses stdio, Foundry module uses different ports
5. **Incremental Development**: One feature at a time, test thoroughly before moving on

**üîÑ Recovery Strategy:**
1. Fix MCP connection issue (foundry-mcp showing as disabled)
2. Implement GM-only security restrictions with silent failures
3. Add GM connection status banner
4. Only then consider re-implementing dice roll system

Ready for Next Session:

üö® **Priority 1:** Fix MCP connection - foundry-mcp showing disabled in Claude Desktop
üö® **Priority 2:** Implement GM-only security restrictions (silent for non-GM)  
üö® **Priority 3:** Add GM connection status banner
üéØ **Priority 4:** Manual Connection Control System (after basics work)
üéØ **Priority 5:** Re-implement dice roll system with lessons learned

Recent Decisions
Architecture Choices:

MCP server approach chosen over in-Foundry AI agent
Focus on cost-effective solution using user's existing Claude subscription
Three-phase rollout: MVP ‚Üí Enhanced Features ‚Üí Distribution

Scope Decisions:

Phase 1 MVP: Character info + Compendium search + Read-only operations
Phase 2: Real-time updates + Write operations + Advanced queries
Phase 3: Easy distribution + Community support

Key Insights from Previous Project:

Cost constraints matter for hobbyist gamers
Local AI (Llama3) has limitations for complex agent behavior
External APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic) are powerful but expensive
