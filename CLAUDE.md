Project Context for Claude Code - Foundry VTT MCP Integration

Current Sprint: MVP Production Deployment Sprint

Sprint Goals: Complete production-ready MVP with end-to-end Claude Desktop integration

Sprint Deadline: August 3, 2025 (1 week sprint)

Project Overview

Vision: Create an MCP server that bridges Foundry VTT game data with Claude Desktop, enabling users to have natural AI-powered conversations with their game world data using their own Claude subscriptions.

Target Users: Foundry VTT users who already have Claude Desktop subscriptions and want enhanced game management capabilities

Core Value Proposition: Transform manual searching through game data into natural AI-powered conversations

Tech Stack:



Node.js for MCP server implementation

MCP (Model Context Protocol) for Claude Desktop integration

Foundry VTT API for data access

Testing framework: TBD (Jest/Mocha)

TypeScript vs JavaScript: TBD



Architecture:

Claude Desktop â†” MCP Protocol (stdio) â†” Foundry MCP Server â†” WebSocket â†” Foundry Module â†” Foundry VTT Data

Final Technical Stack:



MCP Server: Node.js + TypeScript + @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.7.0+ + ws (WebSocket)

Foundry Module: TypeScript + Native WebSocket + Foundry API (browser-compatible)

Communication: Native WebSocket between module and MCP server (port 31415)

Authentication: Foundry session-based (no external tokens needed)

Testing: Vitest framework

Logging: Winston structured logging (file-only for MCP stdio compatibility)

Validation: Zod schema validation

Recent Decisions

Architecture Choices:



âœ… **WebSocket over Socket.io**: Replaced socket.io with native WebSocket for browser compatibility

âœ… **File-only logging**: Disabled console output to prevent MCP stdio corruption

âœ… **Port standardization**: Moved from 30000 to 31415 to avoid Foundry conflicts

âœ… **Browser-compatible imports**: Replaced npm package imports with local constants

âœ… **Error handling redesign**: Implemented logAndExit() pattern for graceful MCP shutdowns



Connection Architecture:



âœ… **Dual protocol design**: MCP stdio for Claude Desktop, WebSocket for Foundry VTT

âœ… **Startup order independence**: Components can start in any order, auto-reconnect

âœ… **Claude Desktop managed**: MCP server lifecycle controlled by Claude Desktop

âœ… **Non-blocking connections**: Foundry connection failures don't break MCP server



Scope Decisions:



Phase 1 MVP: Character info + Compendium search + Read-only operations âœ… **COMPLETE**

Phase 2: Real-time updates + Write operations + Advanced queries

Phase 3: Easy distribution + Community support



Critical Issues Resolved:



ðŸ”§ **Socket.io browser incompatibility**: Replaced with native WebSocket implementation

ðŸ”§ **Import resolution failures**: Created local constants to replace shared package imports

ðŸ”§ **MCP stdio corruption**: Implemented stdio-safe error handling with file logging

ðŸ”§ **Tool execution hanging**: Fixed by removing console.error statements

ðŸ”§ **Port conflicts**: Changed from 30000 to 31415, updated all components

ðŸ”§ **Module loading failures**: Fixed ES module imports and browser compatibility



Debugging Session Summary (July 28, 2025)

Major Issues Identified and Resolved:

1. **Tool Execution Hanging (Critical)**
   - **Problem**: MCP server exited unexpectedly during tool calls
   - **Root Cause**: console.error() statements corrupted Claude Desktop's JSON-RPC stdio stream
   - **Solution**: Implemented file-only logging with logAndExit() error handling pattern

2. **Browser Compatibility Crisis (Critical)**
   - **Problem**: socket.io-client not browser-compatible, broke Foundry module loading
   - **Root Cause**: Node.js packages can't run in browser environments
   - **Solution**: Replaced entire socket.io architecture with native WebSocket

3. **Import Resolution Failures (Blocking)**  
   - **Problem**: @foundry-mcp/shared imports failed in browser, settings disappeared
   - **Root Cause**: ES module resolution differences between Node.js and browser
   - **Solution**: Created local constants.ts files, eliminated cross-package imports

4. **Connection Architecture Mismatch (Design)**
   - **Problem**: MCP server and Foundry module used different connection protocols
   - **Root Cause**: Mixed socket.io server with WebSocket client expectations
   - **Solution**: Unified on native WebSocket for server-to-Foundry communication

5. **Port Conflicts (Configuration)**
   - **Problem**: EADDRINUSE errors on port 30000
   - **Root Cause**: Port already in use by Foundry VTT or other services
   - **Solution**: Moved to port 31415, updated all configuration

Key Architectural Learning:
- **MCP servers must be stdio-clean**: Any console output breaks Claude Desktop communication
- **Browser compatibility is non-negotiable**: Foundry modules run in browser, not Node.js
- **Dual protocol design is correct**: MCP stdio + WebSocket for different connection needs

Production Readiness Achieved:
âœ… All major blockers resolved
âœ… End-to-end architecture verified
âœ… Error handling prevents system failures
âœ… Browser and Node.js compatibility confirmed
âœ… Startup order and connection management documented
