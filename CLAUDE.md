Project Context for Claude Code - Foundry VTT MCP Integration
Current Sprint: Discovery & Setup Sprint
Sprint Goals: Complete foundational research and establish technical architecture
Sprint Deadline: August 3, 2025 (1 week sprint)
Project Overview
Vision: Create an MCP server that bridges Foundry VTT game data with Claude Desktop, enabling users to have natural AI-powered conversations with their game world data using their own Claude subscriptions.
Target Users: Foundry VTT users who already have Claude Desktop subscriptions and want enhanced game management capabilities
Core Value Proposition: Transform manual searching through game data into natural AI-powered conversations
Tech Stack:

Node.js for MCP server implementation
MCP (Model Context Protocol) for Claude Desktop integration
Foundry VTT API for data access
Testing framework: TBD (Jest/Mocha)
TypeScript vs JavaScript: TBD

Architecture:
Claude Desktop â†” MCP Protocol â†” Foundry MCP Server â†” Socket.io â†” Foundry Module â†” Foundry VTT Data
Confirmed Technical Stack:

MCP Server: Node.js + TypeScript + @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.7.0+
Foundry Module: TypeScript + socket.io client + Foundry API
Communication: Socket.io WebSocket between module and MCP server
Authentication: Foundry session-based (no external tokens needed)
Testing: Vitest framework
Logging: Winston structured logging
Validation: Zod schema validation

Recent Decisions
Architecture Choices:

MCP server approach chosen over in-Foundry AI agent
Focus on cost-effective solution using user's existing Claude subscription
Three-phase rollout: MVP â†’ Enhanced Features â†’ Distribution

Scope Decisions:

Phase 1 MVP: Character info + Compendium search + Read-only operations
Phase 2: Real-time updates + Write operations + Advanced queries
Phase 3: Easy distribution + Community support

Key Insights from Previous Project:

Cost constraints matter for hobbyist gamers
Local AI (Llama3) has limitations for complex agent behavior
External APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic) are powerful but expensive
Local compendium data access is faster than external APIs

Phase 2: Enhanced Features - Actor Creation Breakthrough - COMPLETED âœ…
The Breakthrough Feature - NOW WORKING:
Users can say: "Create a red dragon named Flameheart using the Adult Red Dragon stat block" and Claude automatically:

âœ… Searches compendium for "Adult Red Dragon" with intelligent fuzzy matching
âœ… Retrieves the complete stat block data with all embedded items/effects
âœ… Creates a new actor with custom name "Flameheart" 
âœ… Optionally adds to current scene (with permission controls)
âœ… Confirms successful creation with detailed feedback

Settings-Based Safety Controls:

âœ… Allow Actor Creation: Toggle Claude's ability to create actors (Default: ON)
âœ… Allow Scene Modification: Toggle Claude's ability to place tokens (Default: OFF)
âœ… Max Actors Per Request: Limit bulk operations 1-10 (Default: 5)
âœ… Enable Write Audit Log: Track all Claude actions (Default: ON)

Success Metric - ACHIEVED âœ…:
Users can say: "Create three goblin scouts named Sneak, Peek, and Seek" and Claude automatically finds goblin stat blocks, creates three distinct actors, and adds them to the current scene.

Technical Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…:

âœ… New MCP Tools: create-actor-from-compendium, get-compendium-entry-full, validate-actor-creation
âœ… Enhanced Foundry Module: Complete write operation capabilities with safety system
âœ… Natural Language Processing: Complex parsing for creature types, names, quantities
âœ… Safety Mechanisms: Bulk limits, data validation, transaction rollback, comprehensive error handling

Research Findings
Foundry API Access - RESOLVED:
âœ… Must access Foundry while running (socket.io requires active connection)
âœ… Authentication: Foundry module + external MCP server architecture
âœ… Socket.io v4 with game.socket direct access + CONFIG.queries system
âœ… No built-in rate limiting, but WebSocket connection management needed
MCP Implementation - RESOLVED:
âœ… Official @modelcontextprotocol/sdk TypeScript package (v1.7.0+)
âœ… StdioServerTransport for Claude Desktop connection
âœ… Zod schema validation for tool parameters
âœ… Winston structured logging + Vitest testing framework
Technical Architecture - RESOLVED:
âœ… TypeScript + ESLint (strict) + Prettier configuration
âœ… Monorepo: Foundry module + external MCP server
âœ… Foundry module handles socket.io + session auth, MCP server handles Claude
âœ… Configuration: dotenv + zod validation + Foundry Settings API
Code Standards (To Be Established)
Conventions: TBD after research phase

Documentation: README-driven development + JSDoc
Git Strategy: Feature branches + regular commits with Asana task links
