# Repository Cleanup Summary

## What Was Removed

This commit history was cleaned to remove personal and sensitive information before public sharing.

### Files Removed from Git Tracking:
- `runpod_info.md` - API keys and credentials
- `Caddyfile.example` - Personal domain configurations  
- `REMOTE_SETUP.md` - Server-specific setup details
- `claude_desktop_config.example.json` - Personal SSH configuration
- `env.template` - Configuration template (available locally, not tracked)
- `test-*.js` - Personal test scripts with endpoints
- `.specstory/` - AI conversation history  
- `.cursor/` - IDE metadata
- `.claude/` - IDE metadata
- `REMOTE_COMFYUI_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Personal configuration details
- `configure-module-remote-mode.md` - Server-specific instructions

### Files Sanitized:
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Removed personal domain names and S3 bucket names
- `configure-remote-comfyui.sh` - Replaced personal server addresses with placeholders
- `SECURITY.md` - Already had placeholders, no changes needed

### What Remains:
✅ All source code and functionality  
✅ Generic documentation with placeholders  
✅ Security check scripts  
✅ Build and installation tools  
✅ Example configuration files (.env.example)  

## Security Measures

- Comprehensive `.gitignore` for sensitive files
- `check-secrets.sh` script validates no secrets before commits
- All personal domains replaced with generic placeholders
- All API keys and credentials removed
- Git history cleaned via force push

## For Users

To set up your own instance:

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your credentials
3. Follow `QUICKSTART.md` for detailed setup instructions
4. See `FEATURES.md` for RunPod integration details

All sensitive configuration is done via environment variables and never committed to Git.
