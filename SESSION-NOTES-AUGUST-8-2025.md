# Session Notes - August 8, 2025
## Foundry VTT MCP Integration Development

### 🎯 **Current State - Ready for Tomorrow**

**Branch:** `feature/creature-discovery-overhaul-v0.4.1`  
**Status:** ✅ Creature discovery system complete and production-ready  
**Fallback:** Branch contains only today's creature discovery work, other changes uncommitted

### 🚀 **Version 0.4.1 Achievement Summary**

**✅ COMPLETED TODAY - Creature Discovery System Overhaul:**
1. **Fixed Critical Parameter Validation** - Range objects now work (`{min: 10, max: 14}`)
2. **Implemented Pack Prioritization** - 5-tier system searches relevant content first  
3. **Increased Result Limits** - 500+ creatures instead of 20-100 for comprehensive surveys
4. **Revolutionary Paradigm** - "Survey and Select" replaces "Hunt and Check" workflow

**🛡️ FALLBACK PROTECTION:**
- Branch has ONLY today's creature discovery changes committed
- Previous session changes (dice rolls, settings, etc.) remain uncommitted  
- Master branch remains stable at v0.4.0
- Easy rollback available if needed

### 📊 **Branch Status Analysis**

**✅ COMMITTED TO BRANCH (Safe Fallback):**
- `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/compendium.ts` - Parameter validation fixes
- `packages/foundry-module/src/data-access.ts` - Pack prioritization system
- Original CLAUDE.md updates (from commit)

**⚠️ UNCOMMITTED (Previous Sessions):**
- `packages/foundry-module/src/main.ts` - Dice roll improvements
- `packages/foundry-module/src/queries.ts` - Query handler updates
- `packages/foundry-module/src/settings.ts` - Settings system work
- `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts` - Server improvements
- `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/dice-roll.ts` - Dice roll tool updates
- `packages/foundry-module/src/connection-settings-form.ts` - New settings form
- `packages/foundry-module/templates/` - Template files
- Current CLAUDE.md changes (today's documentation)

### 🎯 **Tomorrow's Session Options**

#### **Option 1: Merge Current Work (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Action:** Merge `feature/creature-discovery-overhaul-v0.4.1` to master
- **Benefit:** Move stable v0.4.1 creature discovery to production
- **Risk:** Low - only contains today's tested improvements
- **Fallback:** Easy revert if issues found

#### **Option 2: Continue Development**  
- **Action:** Add more features to current branch
- **Benefit:** Build on today's momentum
- **Risk:** Medium - mixing multiple features in one branch
- **Fallback:** Creature discovery work already committed separately

#### **Option 3: Big Changes Preparation**
- **Action:** Stage uncommitted work, create new experimental branch
- **Benefit:** Preserve all work while enabling risky experiments
- **Risk:** Low - multiple fallback points
- **Fallback:** Multiple stable states (master, feature branch, stashed work)

### 🛠️ **Technical Status**

**Production Ready Systems:**
- ✅ **Creature Discovery:** Revolutionary "Survey and Select" system operational
- ✅ **MCP Integration:** 17 tools working with Claude Desktop
- ✅ **Core Functionality:** Character access, compendium search, scene data
- ✅ **Actor Creation:** Natural language creature generation
- ✅ **Quest System:** AI-powered journal management

**Known Issues (Manageable):**
- 🔧 **Dice Roll Modifiers:** Working but could use polish (skill modifiers, etc.)
- 🔧 **Settings UI:** Functional improvements available but not critical
- 🔧 **Connection Management:** Enhanced controls available but not required

### 📋 **Pre-Session Checklist**

**Before Making Big Changes:**
1. ✅ **Current Work Protected** - Creature discovery safely committed
2. ✅ **Master Branch Clean** - Stable fallback point maintained  
3. ✅ **Uncommitted Work Identified** - Previous session improvements cataloged
4. ⚠️ **Decision Needed** - Merge current work vs. continue development
5. ⚠️ **Backup Strategy** - Choose approach for preserving uncommitted changes

### 🚨 **Risk Management**

**Low Risk (Safe to Proceed):**
- Merging current creature discovery branch to master
- Creating new feature branches from current state
- Committing previous session improvements to current branch

**Medium Risk (Prepare Fallbacks):**
- Major refactoring of existing systems
- Experimental features that might break compatibility
- Large-scale architectural changes

**High Risk (Multiple Fallbacks Required):**
- Changes affecting MCP protocol integration
- Foundry API compatibility modifications  
- Breaking changes to existing tool interfaces

### 🎯 **Recommended Next Actions**

1. **Immediate:** Review and merge creature discovery improvements to master
2. **Short-term:** Commit remaining previous session improvements 
3. **Medium-term:** Plan next major feature development
4. **Long-term:** Prepare for community distribution

**🏆 Yesterday's Win:** Revolutionary creature discovery system complete  
**🎯 Tomorrow's Goal:** Secure improvements and plan next development phase  
**🛡️ Safety Net:** Multiple fallback points and protected master branch
