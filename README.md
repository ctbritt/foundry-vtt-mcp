# Foundry VTT MCP Integration

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges Foundry VTT game data with Claude Desktop for AI-powered interactions.

## What This Does

Transform your Foundry VTT game management with AI-powered conversations:

- **Ask Claude about character stats and abilities**
- **Search through compendium data using natural language** 
- **Create actors, NPCs, and quests from simple prompts**
- **Get scene information and world details**
- **Interactive dice roll coordination**
- **Enhanced creature discovery with instant filtering**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Foundry VTT v11+** (tested on v13)
- **Node.js 18+** and npm 9+
- **Claude Desktop** with MCP support
- **Active Claude subscription**

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Install the Foundry Module

**Option A: Manual Installation (Current)**
1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract to your Foundry `Data/modules/` directory
3. Enable "Foundry MCP Bridge" in Module Management

**Option B: Foundry Package Browser (Coming Soon)**
- Search for "MCP Bridge" in the Foundry package browser

#### 2. Install and Run MCP Server

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/adambdooley/foundry-vtt-mcp-integration.git
cd foundry-vtt-mcp-integration

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Start MCP server
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "foundry-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/foundry-mcp-integration/packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "FOUNDRY_HOST": "localhost",
        "FOUNDRY_PORT": "31415"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Connect and Use

1. Start Foundry VTT and load your world
2. Start the MCP server (`npm run dev`)
3. Open Claude Desktop
4. Start chatting with Claude about your game data!

## Example Usage
