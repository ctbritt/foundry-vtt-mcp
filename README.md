# Foundry VTT MCP Integration - Session Report

**Date:** August 8, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Creature Discovery System Architecture & Debugging  
**Status:** Architecture Decision Made - Ready for Implementation

## Today's Discovery & Problem Analysis

### The Core Issue Uncovered
Through extensive debugging, we discovered that Foundry VTT's compendium indexes contain **only basic metadata**:

```javascript
// What's Available in Foundry Compendium Index:
{
  id: "ddbWarlor2560956",
  name: "Warlord",
  type: "npc", 
  pack: "world.ddb-monsters",
  description: "Brief description",
  hasImage: true,
  img: "path/to/image.webp"
}

// What's MISSING (but needed for filtering):
// ‚ùå challengeRating
// ‚ùå creatureType (humanoid, dragon, etc.)  
// ‚ùå hitPoints, armorClass
// ‚ùå size, alignment
// ‚ùå hasSpells, hasLegendaryActions
// ‚ùå abilities (STR, DEX, etc.)
```

### Failed Approaches Attempted

**‚ùå Real-time Document Loading**
- Loading full documents one-by-one during search
- **Result:** Query timeouts (>2 minutes)
- **Issue:** Too slow for user experience

**‚ùå Batch Document Loading**  
- Loading entire compendium packs at once
- **Result:** Still caused timeouts
- **Issue:** Still too much data transfer during search

**‚ùå Enhanced Cache System**
- Pre-computed cache built on first search
- **Result:** First search always times out
- **Issue:** Terrible user experience - users expect instant results

**‚ùå Name Pattern Matching**
- Intelligent patterns like CR 12 ‚Üí "warlord", "champion" 
- **Result:** Won't work reliably without actual CR data
- **Issue:** False positives/negatives, not scalable

## Tomorrow's Solution: Persistent Enhanced Index

### Architecture Decision
We will implement a **Persistent Enhanced Creature Index** system that:

1. **Pre-extracts** all missing data during one-time setup
2. **Stores persistently** in Foundry world database  
3. **Updates incrementally** when compendiums change
4. **Provides instant search** against cached data

### Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **No timeouts** - Search against pre-built data
- ‚úÖ **Rich filtering** - CR, creature type, abilities available  
- ‚úÖ **Persistent** - Survives Foundry restarts
- ‚úÖ **Smart updates** - Only rebuilds changed packs
- ‚úÖ **Great UX** - Fast results after one-time setup

### Implementation Plan

**Storage Strategy:**
```javascript
const enhancedIndex = {
  metadata: {
    version: "1.0.0",
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    packFingerprints: { /* change detection */ }
  },
  creatures: [
    {
      // Basic + Enhanced data combined
      id, name, pack, type,
      challengeRating: 12,
      creatureType: "humanoid",
      hitPoints: 229,
      // ... all searchable fields
    }
  ]
};
```

**Change Detection:**
- Pack fingerprints (lastModified, documentCount, checksum)
- Foundry hooks for real-time updates
- Manual rebuild button as failsafe

**User Experience:**
- First time: "Building enhanced creature index..." (30-60 seconds)
- Subsequent searches: Instant results
- Background updates when packs change

## Current Status

### Working Features ‚úÖ
- **MCP Bridge Connection**: 17 tools available, GM-only access
- **Basic Search**: Text-based search works perfectly
- **Core Functionality**: Character info, compendium access, quest creation

### Known Issues üö®
- **Creature Filtering**: CR and creature type filters don't work (need enhanced index)
- **Performance**: Complex searches timeout without pre-built index

### Files Modified Today
- `packages/foundry-module/src/data-access.ts` - Simplified search functions
- Removed complex caching system that caused timeouts
- Prepared for persistent index implementation

## Next Session Goals

1. **Implement PersistentCreatureIndex class**
2. **Add one-time index building with progress notifications** 
3. **Implement incremental updates and change detection**
4. **Add manual refresh in settings**
5. **Test full creature discovery workflow**

## Development Context

**Project:** Foundry VTT MCP Integration  
**Goal:** AI-powered creature discovery and encounter building  
**Architecture:** Claude Desktop ‚Üî MCP Server ‚Üî Foundry Module ‚Üî Foundry VTT  
**Status:** Phase 3 Complete, Phase 4 Architecture Planned

**Great work today!** We identified the root cause and designed the correct architectural solution. Tomorrow's persistent index implementation will solve the timeout issues once and for all.
